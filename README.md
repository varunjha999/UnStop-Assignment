Problem Description:
1. There are 80 seats in a coach of a train with only 7 seats in a row and last row of only 3 seats. For
simplicity, there is only one coach in this train.
2. One person can reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
3. If person is reserving seats, the priority will be to book them in one row.
4. If seats are not available in one row then the booking should be done in such a way that the nearby
seats are booked.
5. User can book as many tickets as s/he wants until the coach is full. 6. You don’t have to create login
functionality for this application.


How it should function?
1. Input required will only be the required number of seats. Example: 2 or 4 or 6 or 1 etc.
2. Output should be seats numbers that have been booked for the user along with the display of all the
seats and their availability status through color or number or anything else that you may feel fit.
What all you need to submit?
1. You need to write code (functions) as per the conditions and functionality mentioned above.
2. You need to submit the database structure you’ll be creating as per your code.
3. You need to host it on any of the free/paid platform so that you can provide as a working web URL for
this problem.
4. You need to send us the code a zip file for us to look at your code and evaluate the same. You can also
send us GIT link for the same.
There are some seats already booked in that coach. So your code should be able to find the seats
available and then book them



# Getting Started with Create React App


### `npm start`
![Web capture_18-5-2023_222755_localhost](https://github.com/jitu1212/unstop_full_stack_assign/assets/98046486/f7ac264e-038e-48cb-9f8c-691f9ffefeac)

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
